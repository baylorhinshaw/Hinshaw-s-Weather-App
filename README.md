# Hinshaw-s-Weather-App
In this weather application I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a weather dashboard where you can input a city and it will show current conditions, and future conditions. Search history buttons will also pop up where you can click and it will present you with what you have inputed before. https://baylorhinshaw.github.io/Hinshaw-s-Weather-App/
